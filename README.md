# -Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective-CS-250

I believe that the user's needs are important. Implementing them into the program should be a priority, and the creation of user stories is very helpful. Creating user stories helps developers realize why functions are requested by the user and how to implement a feature in a way that suited the user. 

Generally, I develop programs in steps that I define beforehand. For projects, I require structure meaning I need steps to complete otherwise I won't know where to start. I like that agile incorporates and embrasses the planning aspect of development, and I hope it is incorporated into my future development work. Another aspect of agile I like is the communication focus. Whenever I work with others, I give them updates on progress while asking if they think it's good. I hope I can bring that ideal to software development and ask colleagues if my work is good.

I think a good team member is someone who takes their other team members into account. They learn from their mistakes and make efforts to fix them, while explaining those mistakes to teach others. A good team member is a team player who pulls their own weight while making efforts to help others if needed.
